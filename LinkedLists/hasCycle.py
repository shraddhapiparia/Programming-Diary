# 141. Linked List Cycle

# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to 
# denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        temp = head
        visited = set()
        while temp is not None:
            if temp not in visited:
                visited.add(temp)
                temp = temp.next
            else:
                return True
        return False
